    <h1>Hello,I'm Aldo Orozco trainee developer,</h1>
<h3>I build innovative solutions through teamwork and collaboration.</h3>
<p>Since 2021, I have been focusing on web development, taking various courses and bootcamps to expand my knowledge in this discipline. Currently, I am in my second year of studying Software Development at a technical institute. Although my knowledge level is still that of a trainee, I am highly motivated to learn and become an integral part of any company I join. I am committed to applying my skills to develop effective, high-quality web solutions, and I am confident that I can contribute to the growth of any project assigned to me</p>
